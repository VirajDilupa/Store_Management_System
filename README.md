# Store_Management_System
Store management system for handling orders and requests in a manufacturing company, built with C# Windows Forms and MySQL.

A store management system designed to handle orders and requests originating from the store in a manufacturing company. The system is developed using C# Windows Forms for the application interface, and MySQL for database management. I developed a user-specific login system with distinct access levels for employees, supervisors, and management. The system featured a real-time updated database to ensure the availability of current information, along with secure access through username and password authentication. Additionally, I integrated a feature that allowed users to remotely request parts or equipment from the shop, enhancing overall efficiency. The interface was designed to be user-friendly, facilitating streamlined functionality and ease of data access and communication.
